There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the
law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, 
could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of
the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but
according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their
minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit
set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is
death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
